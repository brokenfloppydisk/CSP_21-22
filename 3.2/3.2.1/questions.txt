- Observe the contents of the co2_data.csv file you downloaded at the beginning of this activity.
  1. What is the unit of measure for the CO2 average and what does it stand for?
  

The CO2 is measured in PPM, or parts per million. This is the number of CO2 molecules in 1 million molecules of air without water vapor.

  2. What do you think the column decimal_year stands for?

It represents the year and the amount of time that has passed in it. For example, the 182nd day of the year could be represented by the decimal 0.4986.

- Why does the line have those four huge dips close to -100? What should we do about them? 

These dips are from months where the data was not recorded. They should be filtered out.

# Conclusion Question 1
Ecosystems such as coral reefs are especially sensitive to temperature changes, and can collapse even after relatively small changes such as 0.5 degrees. Additionally, climate change is dangerous because, even if the Earth stops warming, the retained heat in the oceans and much of the planet will continue to cause negative effects, years in the future.
