# CSP_21-22
This repository contains my projects for AP Computer Science Principles in the 2021-2022 School Year.

Many of the projects are also hosted on replit, under my profile, [KyleHuang5](https://replit.com/@KyleHuang5), 
and [Brianna Adewinmbi's](https://github.com/adewinmbi) replit profile [@badewinmbi](https://replit.com/@badewinmbi),
who I worked together with for several projects.

Thank for to Mr. Virak for teaching the class, and to Brianna for working with me on many of the projects!
