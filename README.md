# Kyle Huang - AP Computer Science Principles 21-22

This repository contains my projects for AP Computer Science Principles in the 2021-2022 School Year.

## Credits

Many of the projects are also hosted on replit, under my profile, [@KyleHuang5](https://replit.com/@KyleHuang5),
and [Brianna Adewinmbi's](https://github.com/adewinmbi) replit profile [@badewinmbi](https://replit.com/@badewinmbi),
who I worked together with for several projects.

Additionally, I also have created a [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11gSV_4jPkE6C1P7DlsKN9F40VETz6nTT?usp=sharing) with a more complete set of files from every project.

Thank for to [Mr. Virak](https://github.com/jonvirak)) for teaching the class and giving me advice, and to [Brianna](https://github.com/adewinmbi) for working with me on so many of the projects!

## Content

- Turtle Projects:
  - A set of beginning Python projects using the turtle libary.
  - [Turtle Escape](https://replit.com/@badewinmbi/Turtle-Escape) - A turtle algorithmically escapes a recursively generated maze.
  - [Turtle Tower Defence](https://replit.com/@badewinmbi/Turtle-Game) - An object-oriented tower defence game made with Brianna in Turtle, which makes usage of asynchronous code.
  - Random Pattern Generator - draws a random set of circular patterns onto the canvas.
  - Sierpinski Triangle - Iteratively draws a Sierpinski Triangle.
- GUI Projects:
  - A small set of projects created with Tkinter.
  - [Command Line GUI](https://replit.com/@badewinmbi/227CreatingCommandLineGUI#main.py) - A command-line gui for network commands such as traceroute and nslookup.
- Data Analysis Projects:
  - Usage of Pandas, Matplotlib, and other libraries to analyze data using python.

## Personal Notes

These projects are what got me to become invested in Python, and although I was not familiar with coding conventions and good practices at first, the constant
practice from this class allowed me to become a better programmer and eventually develop better practices in my own personal projects, such as
[Ciphers](https://github.com/brokenfloppydisk/Ciphers), such as documentation (docstrings), type hinting, code formatting, and not relying on suboptimal
practices such as global variables. Although there are many mistakes I would like to go back and fix in the code in these projects, they allow me to look
back and see what mistakes I made when I first started to program in Python, and how my coding style has changed.
