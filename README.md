# Kyle Huang - AP Computer Science Principles 21-22
This repository contains my projects for AP Computer Science Principles in the 2021-2022 School Year.

Many of the projects are also hosted on replit, under my profile, [@KyleHuang5](https://replit.com/@KyleHuang5), 
and [Brianna Adewinmbi's](https://github.com/adewinmbi) replit profile [@badewinmbi](https://replit.com/@badewinmbi),
who I worked together with for several projects.

Additionally, I also have a [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11gSV_4jPkE6C1P7DlsKN9F40VETz6nTT?usp=sharing) with several of the projects, but it is not consistently updated.

Thank for to Mr. Virak for teaching the class, and to Brianna for working with me on many of the projects!
